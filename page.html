            <h1>Biography of Nelson Mandela</h1>
            
            <section id="introduction">
                <p>
                    Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of <a class= "inline" href="#">Mvezo</a>, 
                    in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. 
                    His mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela, 
                    principal counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. 
                    In 1930, when he was 12 years old, his father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of 
                    Jongintaba at the Great Place in Mqhekezweni1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hearing the elders’ stories of his ancestors’ valour during the wars of resistance, 
                    he dreamed also of making his own contribution to the freedom struggle of his people.
                </p>
                <img id="overlay" src="https://www.nelsonmandela.org/uploads/_imager/uploads/files/164068/Video-overlay-Mandela_W1400_H788_Mcrop_upscale1_CZ1_I1_Q80_P50-50_WQ70.png">
                <p>
                    
                    He attended primary school in <a class="inline" href="#">Qunu</a> where his teacher, 
                    Miss Mdingane, gave him the name Nelson, 
                    in accordance with the custom of giving all schoolchildren “Christian” names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He completed his Junior Certificate at Clarkebury Boarding Institute and went on to Healdtown, 
                    a Wesleyan secondary school of some repute, where he matriculated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mandela began his studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University 
                    College of Fort Hare but did not complete 
                    the degree there as he was expelled for joining in a student protest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On his return to the Great Place at Mqhekezweni the King was furious and said if he didn’t return to 
                    Fort Hare he would arrange wives for him and his cousin Justice. 
                    They ran away to Johannesburg instead, arriving there in 1941. 
                    There he worked as a mine security officer and after meeting Walter Sisulu, an estate agent, 
                    he was introduced to Lazer Sidelsky. 
                    He then did his articles through a firm of attorneys – Witkin, Eidelman and Sidelsky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He completed his BA through the University of South Africa and went back to Fort Hare for his graduation in 1943.

                    Meanwhile, he began studying for an LLB at the University of the Witwatersrand. By his own admission he was a poor 
                    student and left the university in 1952 without graduating. He only started studying again through the 
                    University of London after his imprisonment in 1962 but also did not complete that degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1989, while in the last months of his imprisonment, 
                    he obtained an LLB through the University of South Africa. He graduated in absentia at a ceremony in Cape Town.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mandela, while increasingly politically involved from 1942, only joined the African 
                    National Congress in 1944 when he helped to form the ANC Youth League (ANCYL).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1944 he married Walter Sisulu’s cousin, Evelyn Mase, a nurse. 
                    They had two sons, Madiba Thembekile "Thembi" and Makgatho, and two daughters both called Makaziwe, 
                    the first of whom died in infancy. He and his wife divorced in 1958.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mandela rose through the ranks of the ANCYL and through its efforts, the ANC adopted a more radical mass-based policy, 
                    the Programme of Action, in 1949.

                    In 1952 he was chosen as the National Volunteer-in-Chief of the Defiance Campaign with Maulvi 
                    Cachalia as his deputy. This campaign of civil disobedience against six 
                    unjust laws was a joint programme between the ANC and the South African Indian Congress. 
                    He and 19 others were charged under the Suppression of Communism Act for their part in the campaign and 
                    sentenced to nine months of hard labour, suspended for two years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A two-year diploma in law on top of his BA allowed Mandela to practise law, 
                    and in August 1952 he and Oliver Tambo established South Africa’s first black law firm, Mandela & Tambo.

                <p>
                    At the end of 1952 he was banned for the first time. As a restricted person he was only permitted to 
                    watch in secret as the Freedom Charter was adopted in Kliptown on 26 June 1955.

                <h2>
                    The Treason Trial
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mandela was arrested in a countrywide police swoop on 5 December 1956, 
                    hich led to the 1956 Treason Trial. Men and women of all races found 
                    themselves in the dock in the marathon trial that only ended when the last 28 accused, 
                    including Mandela, were acquitted on 29 March 1961.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 21 March 1960 police killed 69 unarmed people in a 
                    protest in Sharpeville against the pass laws. This led to the country’s 
                    first state of emergency and the banning of the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) 
                    on 8 April. Mandela and his colleagues 
                    in the Treason Trial were among thousands detained during the state of emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the trial Mandela married a social worker, Winnie Madikizela, on 14 June 1958. 
                    They had two daughters, Zenani and Zindziswa. The couple divorced in 1996.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Days before the end of the Treason Trial, 
                    Mandela travelled to Pietermaritzburg to speak at the All-in Africa Conference, 
                    which resolved that he should write to Prime Minister Verwoerd requesting a national 
                    convention on a non-racial constitution, and to warn that should he not agree there would be 
                    a national strike against South Africa becoming a republic. 
                    After he and his colleagues were acquitted in the Treason Trial, 
                    Mandela went underground and began planning a national strike for 29, 30 and 31 March.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the face of massive mobilisation of state security the strike was called off early. 
                    In June 1961 he was asked to lead the armed struggle and helped to establish Umkhonto weSizwe 
                    (Spear of the Nation), 
                    which launched on 16 December 1961 with a series of explosions.

                    On 11 January 1962, using the adopted name David Motsamayi, 
                    Mandela secretly left South Africa. He travelled around Africa and 
                    visited England to gain support for the armed struggle. 
                    He received military training in Morocco and Ethiopia and returned to 
                    South Africa in July 1962. He was arrested in a police roadblock outside 
                    Howick on 5 August while returning from KwaZulu-Natal, where he had briefed ANC 
                    President Chief Albert Luthuli about his trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was charged with leaving the country without a permit and inciting workers to strike. 
                    He was convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment, which he began serving at the 
                    Pretoria Local Prison. 
                    On 27 May 1963 he was transferred to Robben Island and returned to Pretoria on 12 June. 
                    Within a month police raided Liliesleaf, a secret hideout in Rivonia, Johannesburg, 
                    used by ANC and Communist Party activists, and several of his comrades were arrested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 9 October 1963 Mandela joined 10 others on trial for sabotage in what became known as the Rivonia Trial. 
                    While facing the death penalty his words to the court at the end of his famous "Speech from the Dock" 
                    on 20 April 1964 became immortalised:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <span class="left">”</span> I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. 
                    I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together 
                    in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. 
                    But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. <span class="right">”</span>

                    On 11 June 1964 Mandela and seven other accused, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada, Govan Mbeki, 
                    Raymond Mhlaba, Denis Goldberg, Elias Motsoaledi and Andrew Mlangeni, were convicted and the 
                    next day were sentenced to life imprisonment. 
                    Goldberg was sent to Pretoria Prison because he was white, while the others went to Robben Island.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mandela’s mother died in 1968 and his eldest son, Thembi, in 1969. He was not allowed to attend their funerals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 31 March 1982 Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town with Sisulu, Mhlaba and Mlangeni. 
                    Kathrada joined them in October. When he returned to the prison in November 1985 after prostate surgery, 
                    Mandela was held alone. Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee visited him in hospital. 
                    Later Mandela initiated talks about an ultimate meeting between the apartheid government and the ANC.

                    True to his promise, Mandela stepped down in 1999 after one term as President.

                    Nelson Mandela never wavered in his devotion to democracy, 
                    equality and learning. Despite terrible provocation, he never answered racism with racism. 
                    His life is an inspiration to all who are oppressed and deprived; 
                    and to all who are opposed to oppression and deprivation.

                        1. Nelson Mandela's father died in 1930 when Mandela was 12 and his mother 
                        While the autobiography Long Walk to Freedom says his father died when he was nine, 
                        died in 1968 when he was in prison. 
                        In fact, the original Long Walk to Freedom manuscript (written on Robben Island) 
                        historical evidence shows it must have been later, most likely 1930. 
                        states the year as 1930, when he was 12.
